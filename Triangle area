//Just schoolwork. Had to write code that calculates the area of an triangle when base is 7m and height 4m.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int base = 7;
    int height = 4;
    int area = base*height/2;
    printf("\nArea of triangles is %dm2 when base is 7m and height 4m\n", area, base, height);
    return 0;
}

//Might come back to this one as well when I'm more experienced and improve it = trim it down.
